# Data-collection-HW
This project focuses on web scraping and data analysis of Mars-related data using Python. The primary objectives are to scrape news articles about Mars, including their titles and preview texts, and to extract and analyze Mars weather data from an HTML table. The first part of the project involves automated browsing with Splinter and data extraction using Beautiful Soup to gather Mars news articles, which are then stored in a list of dictionaries. In the second part, we scrape temperature and atmospheric pressure data from a Mars weather table, analyze it with Pandas, and visualize key insights such as temperature variations across months, pressure differences, and the Martian year length. The project culminates in exporting the cleaned and analyzed data into a CSV file for further use.
